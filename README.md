# Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to allow potential candidates to confirm they have all the necessary prerequistes installed to run our practical test projects.

The project is a .NET 5 application with both a standard xUnit and also Specflow-based xUnit BDD Specs project.
For the latter project, you'll need the "Specflow for Visual Studio 2019" extension installed.

If everything is working, both the Specs and Tests projects will have one passing test each.
